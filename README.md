# GPS Odometer

The GPS Odometer is a plugin for OpenCPN version 5.0 and higher. It is a simple odometer with these basic functions:

    An optional Speedometer with both analog and digital readout.
    A Total Distance log, always displayed.
    A Trip Distance log, always displayed.
    An optional Deparure / Arrival timer with digital readout
    A Trip reset button that resets Trip, Departure Time and Arrival Time
    An optional Leg Trip time and Distance including a Leg reset button

This version is simply an extension to GPG-Odometer where most of the functionality for frontend 2 has been added. All functions are otherwise the same.
The implemetation is far from complete, mostly due to my limited programming knowledge but also due to the fact that the descriptions I've found so far are mainly for Windows. I'm using linux (Ubuntu 20.04). I've tried all the descriptions I could find but to no avail.

This is as far as I will go.

Have spent a lot of effort trying to get the linux build environment for frontend2 working. Generated accounts for appveyor, travis and circleci. My existing free cloudsmith account suddenly expired (had it since 2012). All this together made me come to the conclusion that someone else need to continue.

I will use the GPS Odometer 'as-is' on my boat and if someone else feels obliged to take over the project - Please Do.
