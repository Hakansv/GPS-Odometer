# GPS Odometer

The GPS Odometer is a plugin for OpenCPN version 5.0 and higher. It is a simple odometer with these basic functions:

    An optional Speedometer with both analog and digital readout.
    A Total Distance log, always displayed.
    A Trip Distance log, always displayed.
    An optional Deparure / Arrival timer with digital readout
    A Trip reset button that resets Trip, Departure Time and Arrival Time
    An optional Leg Trip time and Distance including a Leg reset button

This version is simply an extension to GPG-Odometer where most of the functionality for frontend 2 has been added. All functions are otherwise the same.
The implemetation is far from complete, mostly due to my limited C++ knowledge but also due to the fact that the descriptions I've found so far are for Windows. I'm using linux (Ubuntu 20.04)!

Any assistance is welcome!
